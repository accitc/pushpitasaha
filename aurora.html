<p>
The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south.<br />
<h3>They are an ethereal display of colored lights shimmering across the night sky - the aurora borealis or northern lights. </h3>
Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or shooting rays that light up the sky with an eerie glow.Aurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins approximately 70 meters (230 feet) above the Earth’s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer creating the noise.<br />

<div id="text" style="vertical-align:middle" class="wow animated flipInX" data-wow-delay="1s"> <h1>Where is the best place to see the Northern Lights?</h1><br/>
<p>
Imagine if there was one best place to see the Northern Lights! Overnight it would become the Costa del Aurora with high rise Northern Lights viewing hotels and people in the street handing out leaflets offering a free drink with every Aurora chase.
<br />
<h3>Southern Lights, Northern Lights, Extra-Terrestrial Lights:</h3>
The lights appear in both the northern and southern hemispheres and even on other planets but from an Aurora hunting point of view, only the Northern Lights are a genuinely viable option.
<h3>Northern Scandinavia:</h3>
Essentially, the Aurora is most frequently visible in Northern Scandinavia in a band that stretches between 66°N and 69°N and it is very difficult to be any more exact than that. Yes, the band expands when geomagnetic activity is higher but most commonly, the lights are fairly localised to an area just above the Arctic Circle that we call the Aurora Zone.

<div id="text" style="vertical-align:middle" class="wow animated flipInX" data-wow-delay="1s"> <h1>Why are the Northern Lights coloured differently?</h1><br/>
<p>
<h3>"The majority of auroral displays are predominantly green"</h3>
<h4>Not seeing red</h4>
We don’t see red in the Aurora Borealis too frequently.Reds appear in the Aurora when solar particles react with Oxygen at higher altitudes, generally above 150 miles.

<h4>Yellow and pink</h4>
Very occasionally, you can see yellow and pink in an Auroral display which are associated with only high solar activity as they are simply a mixture of red with green or blue.

<h4>50 shades of green</h4>
When the Oxygen is “excited” at these altitudes it causes the Aurora to appear in shades of green. Coupled with the eye’s greater ability to detect the green colour spectrum and frequent Auroral colour.

<h4>Blue is the colour</h4>
Blue and purple are also colours which are seen less frequently and again, they tend to appear when solar activity is high.
